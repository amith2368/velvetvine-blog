Greetings, tech enthusiasts and fellow keyboard warriors! Today, we embark on a delightful journey into the incredible world of PCs. Prepare to have your minds blown and your laughter muscles tickled, as we dive deep into some mind-boggling PC facts that are sure to make you go "Whoa!" and "Ha!" simultaneously. So, without further ado, let's enter the geek zone!

## Fact #1: The First Computer Bug Was an Actual Bug

We kick off this fantastically geeky adventure with the tale of the very first computer bug. Back in 1947, when computers were nowhere near as sleek and compact as they are today, a peculiar issue arose in the Harvard Mark II computer. It turns out that a moth had found its way into the system and got itself stuck between the relay contacts, causing a malfunction. Justice for all our bugs who crash our PCs, wouldn't you say?

## Fact #2: The Most Powerful Supercomputer May Surprise You

When we think of supercomputers, it's easy to imagine massive rooms filled with blinking lights and humming machines. However, the most powerful supercomputer exists in a rather unexpected location – your very own pocket. Yes, you guessed it right! Today's smartphones have more computational power than the renowned Cray-2 supercomputer that once held the title of the world's most powerful computer. So, the next time you conquer a level in Candy Crush Saga, remember your pocket-sized powerhouse!

## Fact #3: QWERTY Keyboard: The Curious Case

As you type away, did you ever wonder why the keyboard you're using right now is arranged in the somewhat perplexing QWERTY layout? Well, prepare yourself for a blast from the past. In the early days of typing, typewriters were constructed in such a way that if you hit two keys in quick succession, they would often jam. So, the QWERTY layout was born, deliberately designed to slow typists down and prevent those pesky jams. It's like the keyboard is tattling on you, saying, "Hey, slow down there, buddy!"

## Fact #4: The First Computer Mouse Was Made of Wood

Imagine a computer mouse made not of shiny plastic or sleek aluminum, but of... wood! In 1968, when the computer world was still blooming, the first mouse was constructed by Douglas Engelbart and Bill English. It was an odd contraption with wheels and a wooden shell and aptly named "the mouse" due to its tail-like cord. Who would've thought that this humble wooden mouse would be the predecessor of the stylish gaming mice we drool over today?

## Fact #5: The Apollo Guidance Computer – Compact Genius

We all know that the computers that powered the Apollo missions were mind-bogglingly advanced for their time. What's mind-boggling is just how tiny they were. The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) that guided the lunar module to the moon had a memory capacity of only 32 kilobytes. To put that into perspective, it's roughly equivalent to the amount of storage you need for a single cat picture in today's world. Talk about doing wonders with limited resources!

## Fact #6: Computers Can Be Literal Hot Heads

Ever wondered why your computer needs a cooling fan or why your laptop sometimes doubles as a stovetop? Well, dear friends, computers can indeed be hot heads – quite literally! The average computer generates enough heat to fry an egg. So, next time your CPU is running at full throttle, remember to crack open an egg for breakfast and let your computer join in on the morning feast!

## Fact #7: The First Computer Programmer Was a Woman

Bust out your feminist hats and throw confetti because the world's first computer programmer was, you guessed it, a woman! Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or more commonly known as Ada Lovelace, wrote the world's first algorithm for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine in the mid-1800s. She truly was a visionary and a trailblazer for women in the world of computer science. Kudos to Ada for showing us that women can code and slay it with style!

## Fact #8: Steve Jobs' First Job at Atari

Before he became the iconic co-founder of Apple Inc., Steve Jobs had his humble beginnings at the gaming company Atari. Jobs was initially assigned to work on a game called "Breakout," in which he convinced his friend Steve Wozniak to help him out. Jobs aimed to reduce the number of chips required to create the game, promising Wozniak half the bonus if he could pull it off. Wozniak succeeded, and Jobs,
