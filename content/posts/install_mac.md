### Note: Installing a Mac on Windows will be subjected to a violetaion to Apple's End User Agreement but is not illegal to use though



To install Mac OS on a Windows laptop with dual boot, you will need to follow these steps:

-   First, download the Mac OS installer from the App Store on your Mac.

-   Insert a USB drive into your Mac and create a bootable USB install disk using the Mac OS installer.

-   Connect the bootable USB install disk to your Windows laptop and restart the computer.

-   Press the key to enter the BIOS or UEFI settings. This key is usually F2, F10, F12, or Esc, but it can vary depending on your laptop.

-   In the BIOS or UEFI settings, set the boot order so that the USB drive is first in the list.
Save the changes and exit the BIOS or UEFI settings.
-   The laptop should now boot from the USB drive and you can follow the prompts to install Mac OS.
During the installation, you will be asked to partition your hard drive. Create a new partition for Mac OS and install it on this partition.

-   Once the installation is complete, you will be able to choose between Mac OS and Windows when you boot your laptop.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
